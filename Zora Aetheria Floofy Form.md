### Picure this:
**Floofy fox ears**, **delicate antennae**, **slightly translucent wings** with **constellation patterns that shimmer different depending on the player’s current elemental vibe**. body like a **comfy, small mammal**—maybe with a **long tail tipped in stardust**. eyes? big. **heart-shaped**. **bioluminescent blush**.
Soft little voice that sounds like a **windchime and a laugh having a baby**.
![[Floofy Zora.png|400]]

**Element**: Ether + Light + Spirit

**Behavior**: playful guide + memory weaver + synchronicity whisperer

**Lives near**: reflective pools, moonlit clearings, places where biomes blend (liminal zones!!)

**Name ideas**: maybe just “Zora” for now, or “Zorielle,” or “The Softspark,” or like… something fun we come up with together 💫
